.zip to .tar repacker for auto-extracting uploads to CSCS

Utility walks through all ```.zip``` files in the current directory and converts them to ```.tar```s. A small log file is also created with listing of files repacked and a summary with the number of directories and files processed (inside the archives) and their combined size.  
Utility requires no parameters for now.
